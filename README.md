# Box Jumper

An Android game created with Android Studio. 

The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by jumping from platform to platform.

## About The Game
The game uses the accelerometer to control the movement of the player. The further you tilt your phone
the more the player will accelerate in that direction. If the player holds the phone straight up, the player
will slowly decelerate into a stop. The player itself never leaves the Y axis in which it's on and can only move from side to side.
The platforms around the player accelerate up and down giving the illusion that the player is climbing upwards.
